# Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Criteria

## Overview

The Joanna Briggs Institute provides standardized checklists for critical appraisal of different study designs. This document summarizes key criteria for each major study type.

## Simplified Scoring for Abstract-Based Assessment

When only abstracts are available (common in rapid searches), use this simplified approach:

### Key Criteria (Check abstract for these indicators):

**RCT Quality Indicators**:
- ✅ Mentions "randomized" or "randomly assigned"
- ✅ Mentions "blinded" or "double-blind"
- ✅ Reports loss to follow-up <20%
- ✅ Reports intention-to-treat analysis
- ✅ Reports baseline similarity

**Systematic Review Quality Indicators**:
- ✅ Clearly states inclusion/exclusion criteria
- ✅ Describes comprehensive search strategy
- ✅ Mentions quality assessment of included studies
- ✅ Mentions data extraction by multiple reviewers
- ✅ Assesses heterogeneity and/or publication bias

**Observational Study Quality Indicators**:
- ✅ Clearly defines exposure/outcome
- ✅ Addresses confounding (adjustment, matching, stratification)
- ✅ Reports follow-up duration
- ✅ Objective outcome measurement
- ✅ Adequate sample size (>100)

## Quick Assessment Form

For each study, assign:

| Criterion | Present | Absent | Unclear |
|-----------|---------|--------|---------|
| Study design appropriate? | 2 | 0 | 1 |
| Sample adequate? | 2 | 0 | 1 |
| Objective measures? | 2 | 0 | 1 |
| Confounding addressed? | 2 | 0 | 1 |
| Follow-up adequate? | 2 | 0 | 1 |
| Appropriate analysis? | 2 | 0 | 1 |

**Score Interpretation**:
- 12: High quality
- 9-11: Moderate quality
- <9: Low quality
