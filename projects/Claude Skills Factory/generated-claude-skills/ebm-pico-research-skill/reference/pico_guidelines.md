# PICO Framework Guidelines

## What is PICO?

PICO is a mnemonic framework used to formulate focused clinical questions and guide literature searches in evidence-based medicine.

**P** - Patient, Population, or Problem
**I** - Intervention, Exposure, or Prognostic Factor
**C** - Comparison (if applicable)
**O** - Outcome

## Detailed Component Breakdown

### P - Patient/Population/Problem

**What to define:**
- Age, sex, race/ethnicity
- Specific condition or disease
- Disease stage or severity
- Clinical setting (inpatient, outpatient, ICU)
- Comorbidities or risk factors
- Exclusion criteria

**Examples:**
- "Elderly patients >65 years with acute ischemic stroke"
- "Children 2-12 years with recurrent acute otitis media"
- "Adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease stage 3"

**Tips:**
- Be specific enough to narrow search but broad enough to find relevant studies
- Consider if you want to focus on specific subgroups
- Age ranges are important for pediatric and geriatric populations

### I - Intervention

**What to define:**
- Primary intervention of interest
- Treatment, test, exposure, or prognostic factor
- Dose, duration, frequency
- Route of administration
- Timing

**Examples:**
- "Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) 40mg daily subcutaneously"
- "Cognitive behavioral therapy for 12 weekly sessions"
- "Surgical decompression within 24 hours"

**Types of Interventions:**
- **Therapeutic**: Medications, procedures, therapies
- **Diagnostic**: Tests, imaging, biomarkers
- **Prognostic**: Risk factors, genetic markers
- **Harmful**: Exposures, risk factors

### C - Comparison

**What to define:**
- Alternative intervention
- Placebo or sham treatment
- Standard of care
- No treatment (watchful waiting)
- Different dose or route

**Examples:**
- "Compared to unfractionated heparin (UFH)"
- "Versus placebo"
- "Compared to standard wound care"
- "No comparison needed" (for single-arm studies)

**Tips:**
- Not all questions need a comparison
- "Usual care" or "standard treatment" are valid comparators
- Sometimes comparison is implicit (e.g., historical controls)

### O - Outcome

**What to define:**
- Primary clinical outcome of interest
- Patient-important outcomes (mortality, quality of life)
- Surrogate outcomes (lab values, imaging findings)
- Time to event
- Adverse effects or harms

**Examples:**
- "Mortality at 30 days"
- "Time to symptom resolution"
- "Incidence of recurrent VTE"
- "Major bleeding events (ISTH criteria)"
- "Functional independence at 90 days (mRS ≤2)"

**Types of Outcomes:**
- **Patient-important**: Survival, function, symptoms, quality of life
- **Surrogate**: Biomarkers, imaging findings
- **Economic**: Cost-effectiveness, resource utilization
- **Harmful**: Adverse events, complications

## PICO Question Templates

### Therapy/Treatment Questions

**Template**: "In [P], does [I] compared to [C] affect [O]?"

**Examples**:
- "In elderly patients with atrial fibrillation, does direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) compared to warfarin reduce risk of stroke and major bleeding?"
- "In children with acute asthma exacerbation, does nebulized magnesium compared to placebo improve hospital admission rates?"

### Diagnosis Questions

**Template**: "In [P], is/are [I] more accurate than [C] for diagnosing [O]?"

**Examples**:
- "In adults with suspected appendicitis, is CT scan more accurate than ultrasound for confirming diagnosis?"
- "In patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis, is D-dimer testing useful for ruling out the condition?"

### Prognosis Questions

**Template**: "In [P] with [I], what is the risk of [O] over [time frame]?"

**Examples**:
- "In patients with acute ischemic stroke, what is the risk of recurrent stroke within 90 days?"
- "In patients with stage III colon cancer treated with surgery alone, what is 5-year survival?"

### Etiology/Harm Questions

**Template**: "In [P], does [I] compared to [C] increase risk of [O]?"

**Examples**:
- "In smokers, does smoking cessation compared to continued smoking reduce risk of lung cancer?"
- "In patients on NSAIDs, does concomitant PPI use compared to no PPI reduce risk of GI bleeding?"

## Converting Clinical Scenarios to PICO

### Example 1: Stroke Prophylaxis

**Clinical Scenario**:
> "I have a 65-year-old patient with acute ischemic stroke, not eligible for thrombolysis. I need to decide on VTE prophylaxis."

**PICO Extraction**:
- **P**: Adults with acute ischemic stroke, not receiving thrombolysis
- **I**: Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)
- **C**: Unfractionated heparin (UFH) or mechanical prophylaxis
- **O**: Deep vein thrombosis prevention, pulmonary embolism, intracranial hemorrhage

**Search Strategy**:
- Population: "acute ischemic stroke" OR "cerebral infarction"
- Intervention: "low molecular weight heparin" OR "enoxaparin" OR "dalteparin"
- Comparison: "unfractionated heparin" OR "heparin"
- Outcome: "venous thromboembolism" OR "DVT" OR "pulmonary embolism" OR "bleeding"

### Example 2: Pediatric Ear Infections

**Clinical Scenario**:
> "A 4-year-old with recurrent otitis media. Parents asking about antibiotics vs. watchful waiting."

**PICO Extraction**:
- **P**: Children 2-12 years with recurrent acute otitis media
- **I**: Immediate antibiotic treatment
- **C**: Watchful waiting or delayed antibiotic prescription
- **O**: Symptom resolution, recurrence rate, adverse effects

### Example 3: Diabetes Management

**Clinical Scenario**:
> "58-year-old with type 2 diabetes, metformin alone not controlling HbA1c."

**PICO Extraction**:
- **P**: Adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin
- **I**: Addition of SGLT2 inhibitor
- **C**: Addition of sulfonylurea or DPP-4 inhibitor
- **O**: HbA1c reduction, weight change, hypoglycemia risk, cardiovascular outcomes

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too Broad Population**
   - ❌ "In adults..."
   - ✅ "In adults with chronic heart failure NYHA class II-III..."

2. **Vague Intervention**
   - ❌ "Does medication help..."
   - ✅ "Does beta-blocker treatment..."

3. **Missing Outcome**
   - ❌ "Is LMWH better than UFH for stroke patients?"
   - ✅ "Is LMWH better than UFH for preventing DVT in stroke patients?"

4. **Unfocused Comparison**
   - ❌ "Compared to other treatments..."
   - ✅ "Compared to standard dose UFH..."

5. **Multiple Questions**
   - ❌ Combining efficacy and safety in one question
   - ✅ Separate questions for efficacy and adverse effects

## PICO from Clinical Notes

When extracting PICO from clinical note summaries:

### Identify Key Elements:

1. **Patient Characteristics**:
   - Age, sex
   - Primary diagnosis
   - Comorbidities
   - Clinical setting

2. **Clinical Decision Point**:
   - What treatment decision needs to be made?
   - What diagnostic test is being considered?
   - What prognostic information is needed?

3. **Available Options**:
   - What interventions are being considered?
   - What is the standard of care?
   - What alternatives exist?

4. **Relevant Outcomes**:
   - What outcomes matter for this patient?
   - What are the patient's goals and values?
   - What risks need to be considered?

### Example Clinical Note Analysis:

> "72-year-old female, admitted with community-acquired pneumonia.
> CURB-65 score 3. Comorbidities: COPD, HFpEF, CKD stage 3.
> Allergies: Penicillin (rash). Decision: Antibiotic selection."

**PICO Extraction**:
- **P**: Elderly patients (≥65) with moderate-severe CAP (CURB-65 ≥3) and beta-lactam allergy
- **I**: Respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin/moxifloxacin)
- **C**: Combination therapy (macrolide + cephalosporin)
- **O**: Treatment failure, mortality, adverse effects (C. difficile, arrhythmias)

## Tips for Literature Searches

### Use MeSH Terms:
- **P**: Check appropriate MeSH headings for population
- **I**: Use both brand and generic names for medications
- **O**: Include validated outcome measures when available

### Combine with Keywords:
- MeSH terms don't capture all relevant articles
- Include common synonyms and abbreviations
- Use exploded MeSH for broader search

### Apply Filters:
- Study design (RCT, meta-analysis)
- Age groups (when relevant)
- Publication date (determined by clinical question)
- Language (usually English)
- Human studies only
