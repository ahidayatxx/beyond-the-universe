# Default fallback
default:
  years: 7  # When specialty cannot be determined


# Usage Guidelines

# 1. **Match Specialty**: Identify the primary specialty relevant to the clinical question
# 2. **Check Keywords**: Look for keywords that might override the specialty classification
# 3. **Check Special Situations**: Evaluate if any special situations apply
# 4. **Apply Default**: If no match found, use default 7-year range
# 5. **User Override**: Always allow user to modify the year range

# Decision Logic

# 1. If special situation keywords detected → use special situation years
# 2. Else if specialty matches rapidly evolving → use 3-5 years
# 3. Else if specialty matches moderately evolving → use 5-7 years
# 4. Else if specialty matches established treatments → use 7-10 years
# 5. Else → use default 7 years
